# tidal_api  
a quick attempt to document and implement some functions of the Tidal (http://tidal.com) music streaming 
website  
  
within `main.py` exists a rudimentary downloading function, that will download The Notorious B.I.G's 
Greatest Album.  
within `notes` exists my documentation of the hidden api, and some mapping of the required fields, 
and example responses.  
within `theft/__init__.py` exists a Class that handles login, listing album details, tracks on the 
album, and handles downloading of the files to a local directory
